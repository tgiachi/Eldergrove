# Eldergrove: The Ruins of Lost Magic

## Chapter 1: The Call of Eldergrove

The rain fell incessantly on the muddy road as **Kaelion**, a young adventurer with countless journeys behind him, made his way toward the small village of **Dryston**. Beside him walked **Nyx**, his loyal companion, a cat with black and silver fur, whose green eyes gleamed in the evening mist. Nyx was no ordinary cat. Kaelion did not know exactly where he came from, nor how he acquired such extraordinary abilities to sense danger before it even appeared. But in all the years they had spent together, Kaelion had never once doubted Nyx's value as a companion.

Finally arriving at the village gates, Kaelion immediately noticed something strange. Dryston was usually a quiet place, but tonight the atmosphere was heavy, as though an invisible shadow loomed over the inhabitants. People hurried through the streets, avoiding eye contact. The lights in the windows were dim, as though even the flames were too afraid to burn brightly.

"What in the world is going on here?" muttered Kaelion, as Nyx darted ahead, intrigued.

An old tavern appeared before them, the most logical refuge for someone like Kaelion seeking answers. Inside, the air was warm and stifling, but not comforting. The villagers’ eyes briefly lifted, glancing at the adventurer and his cat, before quickly returning to their wooden mugs and hushed conversations.

"Welcome, stranger," rasped the innkeeper. "Sit down, I imagine you're here for answers. Lately, everyone who comes here is."

Kaelion pulled back his hood, letting the rain drip slowly to the floor. "I've heard strange rumors along the road. Something about Eldergrove... and magic fading away."

The innkeeper sighed deeply, as though he were about to tell a story that had become all too familiar, yet still painful.

"Eldergrove is a forest like no other," he began. "Once, druids protected those woods, maintaining the balance between the world of men and the forces that dwell deep within the earth. But now... now that magic is disappearing. The trees bend under an unseen weight, and the ruins beneath them have been awakened."

Kaelion leaned forward, hanging on every word. Nyx, sensing imminent danger, climbed onto his shoulder, his eyes fixed on every movement within the tavern.

"The ruins?" Kaelion asked, his hand tightening around the hilt of his sword.

"Yes, the ruins," the innkeeper replied, his voice trembling. "They say that beneath Eldergrove, there are ancient passages, tunnels, and chambers forgotten by time. But they are not empty. The undead walk those halls again, and it's said that demons have been summoned from the deepest recesses of the world. No one who has gone down there has ever returned."

Kaelion stood, his expression determined. "And the magic? Can it be saved?"

The innkeeper shook his head, but a glimmer of hope flickered in his eyes. "No one knows. But if there's any hope, it lies deep within those ruins. Only those brave enough to explore them might find an answer."

Nyx, perched on his master’s shoulder, let out a low sound, as if approving the impending challenge. Kaelion smiled, thoughtfully scratching his chin.

"Well, it seems Nyx and I have a place to visit."

And so, with the weight of destiny on his shoulders and his loyal companion at his side, Kaelion set off toward Eldergrove, knowing that what he would find beneath its ancient roots would either change the course of the world... or destroy it forever.
